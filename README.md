# Plann.er
This project was developed during the July 2024 Rocketseat NLW Week and it's been currently improved.

Plann.er was created to help people organize they trips by adding their friends or family, destination, dates, activities and interest links. 
It also allows the user to alter the destination and dates and add more people to the trip. 

Simple, isn't? But who knows what tomorrow holds?
